## What is Postman?
Postman is a collaborative platform for API development. Developers (or in this case, technical writers) can use Postman to develop, manage, test and document APIs. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy to collaboratively work on APIs, making it an ideal platform for cross-functional teams.

## Setting Up Postman

1.  Download and install the [Postman app](https://www.postman.com/).
2.  Open the Postman application and complete the setup process.

4.  In the Collection tab, find the most recent collection and click on the **Fork** button to add it to your collection.

## Generating Your Secret Keys

Stripe servers authenticate and authorize API requests using bearer token authorization. To set this up, you will need to create a Stripe account.

1.  Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/ and follow the instructions there to create your account.
2.  The secret key is on the homepage of the dashboard. Click on it to copy it to your clipboard.  
    **NOTE:** Do not share your secret key with other users for security purposes.
3.  Return to the Postman app.
4.  Click **Environments > Add (+)**.
5.  Enter a name for the environment in the Name field (e.g., **Stripe API**).

6.  In the **Variable** cell, enter `secret_key`.
7.  In the **Current Value** cell, paste the secret key copied from the Stripe Dashboard.
8.  Click on **Save**.

9.  To set the environment to the **Stripe API** environment, click on the **Environment** dropdown menu in the top right corner of the workspace.

Your API requests will now be authenticated and authorized by Stripe servers.

## Connection Prerequisites

To connect to the Stripe API, you need the base URL: `https://api.stripe.com`

## Author's Note

This guide is a prequel to the [Stripe API Documentation Sample](https://github.com/pvega62/Portfolio/wiki/Stripe-API-Documentation-Sample). It provides the foundational steps for setting up Postman to connect to the Stripe API, which is essential for testing and documenting API requests effectively.

I wanted to break things up into smaller, more manageable sections to make it easier for users to follow along and implement the steps in their own Postman setup. I thought the user might get overwhelmed by the amount of information presented all at once, so this approach aims to simplify the process.
