# Remote Switch Installation for ADA Compliant Wall-Mounted Range Hoods

## Project Overview
As a Technical Writer for Felix Storch, I created this document for electricians already familiar with appliance installation. I'm including this piece in my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to write clear and concise technical documentation geared towards an expert audience instead of a general audience.

The reason it's sparse is because it assumes a certain level of expertise and familiarity from the installer.

## Notes:
Installation and service must be performed by a qualified installer/electrician.

To avoid fire or electrical shock, turn off the power at the circuit breaker or fuse. Test to ensure that the power is off before wiring.

## Instructions:

Choose a location for mounting the remote switch. The wires might need to be extended based on the distance from the hood.

* **NOTE:** This switch must be installed in accordance with ADA guidelines, the height of the light switch must be between 15" and 48" from the floor. Additional regulations apply if there are any obstructions in front of the switch. For more information, refer to Section 308 of the most recent ADA Standards for Accessible Design at [ada.gov](https://www.ada.gov/).*
